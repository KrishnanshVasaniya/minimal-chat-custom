## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install packages: `npm install`
2. Build the app: `npm run build`
3. Start local server: `npm run preview`for Production mode or `npm run dev` for development mode.

Here's a section you can add to the README to stress the importance of enabling CORS for locally hosted API servers:

## **Important: CORS Configuration for Local API Servers**

When hosting API servers locally (such as LM Studio, Ollama, or other custom endpoints), it is crucial to properly configure **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** settings. This ensures that your browser-based application (like MinimalChat) can communicate with your local API server without being blocked by browser security policies.

### How to Enable CORS
The steps to enable CORS depend on the API server you are using:

#### For LM Studio
1. When starting your LM Studio server

### Troubleshooting CORS Issues
- Ensure that your API server is running and accessible.
- Verify that the CORS settings are correctly configured and applied.
- Check the browser's developer console for detailed error messages.
- If using a custom domain or port, make sure it is included in the allowed origins list.

By properly configuring CORS, you can ensure seamless communication between your locally hosted API server and the MinimalChat application.
